I have gone through the basic concepts and I can use the print statement and user input very easily except `Printf()` function.

I have to go through the loops and other basic concepts tomorrow so that I can do the task easily.

Goal is to master golang so that I can use it in my backend as well as AI/ML projects.

Good night!
